## 📋 Project Guidelines

When creating or modifying projects, please follow these guidelines:

### ✅ Python Projects - Code Style

- **No Functions/Classes** - Keep code simple and procedural for beginners
- **Use Emojis** - Make the UI visually appealing with relevant emojis
- **Clear Comments** - Add comments for complex logic
- **Proper Spacing** - Follow PEP 8: blank lines between sections
- **Consistent Formatting** - Match the style of existing projects

### ✅ Python Projects - Structure

Your project should include:

```python
# 1. Welcome message with emojis
print("🎮 Project Name 🎮")
print("Brief description\n")

# 2. Main game/tool logic with clear sections

# 3. User input with emoji prompts
choice = input("🎯 Your prompt: ")

# 4. Appropriate feedback messages
print("✅ Success message")
print("❌ Error message")

# 5. Goodbye/thank you message
print("\n👋 Thanks for playing!\n")
```

### ✅ Web App Projects - Structure

For web implementation, add to `web-app/js/projects/your-project-name.js`:

```javascript
// 1. HTML Template Function
function getYourProjectHTML() {
    return `
        <div class="project-content">
            <h2>🎮 Your Project Name</h2>
            <!-- Your HTML structure -->
        </div>
        
        <style>
            /* Your project-specific styles */
        </style>
    `;
}

// 2. Initialization Function
function initYourProject() {
    // Get DOM elements
    const btn = document.getElementById('yourBtn');
    
    // Add event listeners
    btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        // Your logic here
    });
}

// 3. Register in getProjectHTML() and initializeProject() in `web-app/js/projects.js`
```

### ✅ Web App Projects - Guidelines

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **CSS Variables** - Use existing theme variables
- **Animations** - Add smooth transitions and effects
- **Accessibility** - Use semantic HTML and proper labels

### ✅ Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** - Use modern Python features
- **No External Dependencies** - Only use standard library
- **Zero Setup** - Project should run immediately
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

### ✅ Naming Convention

- Put each Python project under a category folder (`games/`, `math/`, or `utilities/`) and keep it in its own folder: `category/Project-Name/Project-Name.py`
- Use hyphenated names: `My-Project-Name.py`
- Be descriptive: `Rock-Paper-Scissor.py` not `game.py`
- Use title case for multi-word names: `Number-Guessing-Game.py`
- Match existing naming pattern in repository

## 🏷️ Issue Levels

We label issues by difficulty and type to help contributors find the right tasks. Use these levels when filing or triaging issues.

- **beginner** — Great for new contributors. Small, well-scoped tasks with clear instructions (good-first-issue / easy fixes).
- **intermediate** — Requires some familiarity with the codebase and minor design/logic changes.
- **advanced** — Involves architecture, refactoring, or larger feature work.
- **bug** — A reproducible defect; include steps to reproduce and an expected vs actual description.
- **enhancement** — A non-critical improvement or new feature request.
- **documentation** — Docs, examples, or README updates.
- **design** — Changes to UI, web-app visuals, or user experience.

When creating an issue, add one difficulty label (`beginner`, `intermediate`, or `advanced`) and one type label (`type:bug`, `type:feature`, `type:docs`, `type:design`, `type:devops`, `type:refactor`) where appropriate.
